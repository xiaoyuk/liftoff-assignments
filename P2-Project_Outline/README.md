## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an English learning audio log/community that will allow Chinese English learners (user) to upload (or store) and translate the audio snippets they capture in their daily life. It will allow users to log in, and to create audio entries and edit their translations (their own answers) to the audio messages.

This project was motivated by the need of my mom who wants to learn practical English from daily life, such as audio broadcasts from buses which she rides daily.

### Features
1. User login: Users will be able to log in by creating accounts in the system. Users can choose whether their content is to be shared by the public or only private.

2. Create entries: Users will be able to create new entries like blog posts by uploading their short audio files.

3. Create and Edit translations: Users will be able to write and edit translations (i.e. transcriptions) of the audio file. If they choose their files to be public, they can allow other users to provide their versions of translations as comments under the audio logs.

3. View entries: Users will be able to view a listing of their own entries or any entry that is public.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf templates
Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
1. I will need to learn how to give the users options of at least two kinds of user access: public and private. 
2. I will need to figure out how to allow users to upload audio files and store them in a SQL database.
3. I want the users to be able to easily upload audio entries, ideally directly through their smartphones. (For example, they can attach their audio file to an email, and send the email to an address, which will automatically be created into an entry.)
